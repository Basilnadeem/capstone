<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p> A 20-year-old aspiring web developer, I am driven by a passion for crafting engaging online experiences. With a focus on continuous learning, I am dedicated to mastering various programming languages and frameworks. Beyond coding, I bring strong communication, collaboration, and adaptability skills to the table. When not immersed in code, I enjoy unwinding with gaming, Netflix, and hitting the gym, activities that fuel both my creativity and productivity.</p>
